Here are the classes, structs, unions and interfaces with brief descriptions\+:\begin{DoxyCompactList}
\item\contentsline{section}{\mbox{\hyperlink{class_depth_camera}{Depth\+Camera}} \\*This is used to read the points from the file and saves them in a pointcloud. \textbackslash{}n\+When \mbox{\hyperlink{class_depth_camera_a3fde461a9d8e2d27c20957ea4d55456f}{capture()}} is called, the points are read and saved into a point cloud }{\pageref{class_depth_camera}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\mbox{\hyperlink{class_filterpipe}{Filterpipe}} }{\pageref{class_filterpipe}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\mbox{\hyperlink{class_pass_through_filter}{Pass\+Through\+Filter}} \\*A class that filters out points of a point cloud that lie outside of a given range \textbackslash{}nfilter() filters out unwanted points }{\pageref{class_pass_through_filter}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\mbox{\hyperlink{class_point}{Point}} \\*This class holds the coordinates of the 3D points in the point cloud. ~\newline
 Equal operator ( = = ), is used to check whether or not two points are equal i.\+e. in the same position. ~\newline
 The \mbox{\hyperlink{class_point_ac2bcae726c983efee9098c06fc11c9a2}{distance()}} function returns the distance between two points }{\pageref{class_point}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\mbox{\hyperlink{class_point_cloud}{Point\+Cloud}} \\*A class that holds an array of points to form a \char`\"{}cloud\char`\"{}. \textbackslash{}n\+Holds the points it has in a dynamically created array of points. The array\textquotesingle{}s size is taken as a parameter in the constructor function when the object is created. + operator, returns a single point cloud with points that both point clouds have. ~\newline
= operator, allows a point cloud to copy another one and take all of its points and overwrites its members }{\pageref{class_point_cloud}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\mbox{\hyperlink{class_point_cloud_filter}{Point\+Cloud\+Filter}} }{\pageref{class_point_cloud_filter}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\mbox{\hyperlink{class_point_cloud_generator}{Point\+Cloud\+Generator}} \\*A class creates the required objects for the capturefor object which are filterpipe and transform }{\pageref{class_point_cloud_generator}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\mbox{\hyperlink{class_point_cloud_interface}{Point\+Cloud\+Interface}} \\*A class that used to make the refinement and processing of the cloud simpler }{\pageref{class_point_cloud_interface}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\mbox{\hyperlink{class_point_cloud_recorder}{Point\+Cloud\+Recorder}} \\*This is used to save the points in apoint clouds to a file. \textbackslash{}n\+When \mbox{\hyperlink{class_point_cloud_recorder_aeaa8d173932ea5d518524e0a3a4913dd}{save()}} is called, the points of the point cloud gicen as a paramtere are saved to a text file. \textbackslash{}n\+Returns true if it saves successfully }{\pageref{class_point_cloud_recorder}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\mbox{\hyperlink{class_radius_outlier_filter}{Radius\+Outlier\+Filter}} \\*A class that filters out points of a point cloud that don\textquotesingle{}t have any neighbors \textbackslash{}nfilter() filters out unwanted points }{\pageref{class_radius_outlier_filter}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\mbox{\hyperlink{class_transform}{Transform}} \\*A class that transorms a point cloud to a wanted coordinate system \textbackslash{}ndotransform(point p) Transforms points. \textbackslash{}ndotransform(point\+Cloud pc) sends the points in the point cloud to the other dotransform to transform them }{\pageref{class_transform}}{}
